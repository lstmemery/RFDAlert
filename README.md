# RFDAlert
Script to scrape RFD and email posts that meet certain criteria

Copy the and remove the ".sample" from the sample files.

Install the script's depenencies.

Setup cron or some other way of running the script.

I'd recommend using flock to run the script as it could potentially send things twice otherwise.

Note: This script is crap. It works, but it's crap.
When something goes wrong, expect it to fail horribly.
